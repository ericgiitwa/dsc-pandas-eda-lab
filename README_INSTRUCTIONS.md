SUMMARY.

This project consists of information on the housing market in Ames, IA.
I have used data analysis methods, such as pandas, to summarise the data and make it easier to understand and make financial decisions.
I used the data to view the different correlations between the independent variables and the sale price of the house

the project is renamed and saved  as 'Eric_Giitwa_EDA_with_Pandas.ipynb'
